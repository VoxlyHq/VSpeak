# VSpeak (Voxy Speak)

Welcome to Voxy Speak(VSpeak), an open-source library revolutionizing language translation in software applications. VSpeak is a robust C++ implementation of the Meta Seams Communication library and the ambitious NLLB (No Language Left Behind) project. Our goal is to bridge communication barriers by enabling seamless translation between 200 different languages. We are targeting embedded devices

It uses the [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) tensor library underneath for performance.
